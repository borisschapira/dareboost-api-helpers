# Boris' Dareboost API Helpers

A set of helpers I use to manipulate Dareboost API, using node.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* node 8.11.3+ (may work on minor version but I've not tested)

For node, I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to switch from one node version to another.

### Installing

You will need to start by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/borisschapira/dareboost-api-helpers.git
```

Then enter the folder and install the project using yarn:

```
npm install
```

### Using the helpers

Don't forget to set [your Dareboost API token](https://www.dareboost.com/en/profile/api) (you need to be a customer, see [Dareboost's offers](https://www.dareboost.com/en/offers#gppufs)) right before calling the helper.

To export a user's active tracking configuration:

```
DB_API_TOKEN='your_api_token' npm run page:monitor
```

To export a user's active tracking statistics (the mean or percentiles of the active monitors):

```
DB_API_TOKEN='your_api_token' npm run page:statistics
```

To export the tips that came up most often:

```
DB_API_TOKEN='your_api_token' npm run page:common-tips
```


## Running the tests

Hey! Humâ€¦ I'm gonna write some tests. Some day. In the near future.
